ISO-15919 Unicode Roman <-> funderbunk-transcoder ROMAN

** NOTES ON UPSTREAM (20210705)
AS OF 201210705 on the upstream sanskrit-transcoders fsm xml data
files seem to have these peculiarities -

*** ROMAN is basically IAST
it doesn't have lring, uring. It has ldot rdot instead
*** ROMAN doesn't support uppercase characters.
*** SLP1 accent peculiaries
- SLP1 accents are postfix. (I think they were prefix in
  sanskrit-sqlite)
- a/ indicates a-acute. a^ indicates a-circumflex. a\ indicates
  a-grave. Unfortunately In the context of ISO-15919 These do not
  refer to the phonetics but to orthography.
** CONVERT 

Do we want to create a direct transcoder from :iso15919 to :roman
which converts lring uring to ldot udot and handles uppercase. accents
will be normalised to what :roman expects
